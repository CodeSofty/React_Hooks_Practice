## Overview


## My process

### Built with

- React
- CSS


### What I learned

I took on this challenge to practice with the React Hooks and props as I learned React on my own.

- Setup a React app with Create-React-App, 
- How to use UseState and UseEffect
- Passing props to components.

I also got to test out the Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/), which was fun.
